     * This function allows the owner of the position to close it. The position must exist, be owned by the caller,      and not have already been closed. Upon successful closure, the position is settled, and a `ClosePosition` event is emitted.      If the position is closed in a different oracle version than the open version, a claim position task is created by the liquidator.      Otherwise, the position is immediately claimed, and a `ClaimPosition` event is emitted.      Throws a `NotExistPosition` error if the specified position does not exist.      Throws a `NotPermitted` error if the caller is not the owner of the position.      Throws an `AlreadyClosedPosition` error if the position has already been closed.      Throws a `ClaimPositionCallbackError` error if an error occurred during the claim position callback.
     * @param positionId The ID of the position to close.

     * Throws a `TooSmallTakerMargin` error if the `takerMargin` is smaller than the minimum required margin for the settlement token.      Throws an `ExceedMaxAllowableLeverage` if the leverage exceeds the maximum allowable leverage.      Throws a `NotAllowableTakerMargin` if the taker margin is not within the allowable range based on the absolute quantity and maximum allowable leverage.      Throws a `NotAllowableMakerMargin` if the maker margin is not within the allowable range based on the absolute quantity and min/max take-profit basis points (BPS).      Throws an `ExceedMaxAllowableTradingFee` if the total trading fee (including protocol fee) exceeds the maximum allowable trading fee (`maxAllowableTradingFee`).      Throws a `NotEnoughMarginTransfered` if the margin settlement token balance did not increase by the required margin amount after the callback. Requirements:  - The `takerMargin` must be greater than or equal to the minimum required margin for the settlement token.  - The position parameters must pass the validity check, including leverage limits and allowable margin ranges.  - The position is assigned a new ID and stored in the position storage.  - A keeper task for potential liquidation is created by the liquidator.  - An `OpenPosition` event is emitted with the owner's address and the newly opened position details.
